    <ol>Why Vermont farmers are using urine on their crops</ol>
    <ol>Urine was used as fertiliser in ancient Rome and China. 
        Now farmers in Vermont are bringing this practice back to boost 
        harvests and grow crops in a more sustainable way.</ol>

    <ul> When Betsy Williams goes to the loo, she likes to know her pee won't go to waste. 
        For the last 12 years, she and her neighbours in rural Vermont, US, have diligently 
        collected their urine and donated it to farmers for use as 
        fertiliser for their crops.</ul>
